This was my first React project that required learning how to use Firebase as a backend service. I definitely struggled a lot while learning how to create documents and collections with Firebase in order to store the character coordinates, game image, and leaderboard for each Where's Waldo level. Another challenge was figuring out how to query the database to get the necessary data, but after spending a lot of time reading through the documentation that's provided by Firebase, I managed to succeed in both creating and retrieving the document fields to make the website and gameplay run. I also had to learn how to update a pre-existing collection/document for any newly submitted leaderboard scores which I discovered through the Firebase documentation as well.

While Firebase felt like it had a bit of a learning curve to it, I quickly saw the benefits of being able to store information through a backend service. I can write my own security rules to protect my data from being altered or read by the wrong people, which is something I'll need to be more cognizant of when I begin to deal with sensitive and private company/client information. Overall, I think Firebase makes it easy enough for anyone to utilize their free services as a backend. I can definitely see myself using them again for any smaller projects in the future.
